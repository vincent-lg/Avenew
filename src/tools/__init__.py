"""Package to hold all commands, plus base utilities for commands.

Static commands are contained in this package, sorted in sub-packages.  A package should contain at least one module, within which the command is defined.  It is possible to define packages inside packages with a command hierarchy, although in most cases the need doesn't arise (one command per file, one folder per category, that's usually more than enough).

Grouping commands in categories offers several advantages:
    The player sees commands grouped in the help file, which makes things easier to understand.
    The category name can be defined in the package (`__init__.py` file)
    The command permissions can be defined in the package file too.

In the case of package containing sub-packages, the categories
is looked up in the deeper package first, and then, if not found,
in parent packages.
