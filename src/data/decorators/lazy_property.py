"""Lazy property, to optimize getting and setting data.

The lazy property descriptor is used similarly to a property,
but it caches the data it retrieves the first time it's called
and then will only return this cached data, unless a setter
is called in the meantime.

"""

_MISSING = object()

class LazyPropertyDescriptor:

    """
    Delays loading of property until first access.

    Although extended, this was inspired by Evennia's utility
    (wwww.evennia.com), itself based on the iplementation in the
    werkzeug suite:
        http://werkzeug.pocoo.org/docs/utils/#werkzeug.utils.cached_property

    A lazy property should be used as a decorator over the getter method,
    just like a property.  The difference is that a lazy property will
    call the getter method only once, the first time for this object, and
    then cache the result for following queries.  This allows for fast-access
    to handlers that are not re-created each time the property is called:

        ```python
        class SomeTest(db.Entity):
            @lazy_property
            def db(self):
                return AttributeHandler(self)

            @db.setter
            def db(self, handler):
                raise ValueError("you can't change that")
        ```

    Once initialized, the `AttributeHandler` will be available as a
    property "db" on the object.
