        Now that you have chosen your account username, you should

        will protect your characters on the game.  Other players will
        not be able to see your username and will not know your password,
        unless you tell them, which you shouldn't.

        Preferably choose a password which will be hard to guess, not just
        a word from the dictionary.  You can include letters (without
        or with accents), digits, special characters and so on.  Just
        make sure your password isn't too short.
