    """
    Host service, creating a light messaging client to connect to CRUX.

    Each process can instantiate a host service, which is a client
    designed to connect to the CRUX.  The CRUX is a simple TCP server
    that can be used to trade data with the various processes.

    Data from host to CRUX and reciprocally is in the form of commands.
    A command (sometimes called a 'CRUX command') is a pickled tuple
    containing two information: the command name as a string and
    the command arguments wrapped in a dictionary.  To react to
    a command, the host service or a parent service must define a method,
    named `handle_{command name}`, taking as argument the reader and
    the argument keys of the command.

    For instance, when a game asks CRUX to be registered, CRUX will send
    a confirmation as a command: the command's name is `registered_game`,
    and the argument is a dictionary `{'game_id': ...}` where the ID of the
    game is sent.  Therefore, to intercept this command, the game service
    must define a method `handle_registered_game` with `game_id` as argument:

        async def handle_registered_game(self, reader, game_id):
            ...

    See `CmdMixin` (service/cmd.py) for the communication methods.
