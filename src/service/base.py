"""Abstract class for TalisMUD services.

A service is a component of the game in charge of a specific functionality.
A service can start one or several asynchronous tasks and run while these
tasks also are running.  Services can have a very short life, but most of
them start with processes and end when these processes end as well.

A service can have sub-services.  These services will be started as the
parent service starts.  However, no isolation is granted between services
and sub-services: a service may call a parent, a parent may call a child.
Services know who their parent, sibblings and children are and they will
use their features shamelessly.  A basic hook system exists to allow
services to "subscribe and react" to given events.  These hooks are not
meant for feature isolation, just speedy communication between services.

Lastly, notice that services are built for asynchronous tasks.  Almost
all their methods are asynchronous.  They can perform many of their
communication on the event loop.  Processes can order services and
organize their behavior, but most services know how to reach a different
service for communication and split responsibilities when it's needed.
To some extent, this gives self-contained code, to the exception of hooks.
Once more, however, feature isolation isn't a goal of this design.

        Start the service asynchronously.

        This method SHOULD NOT be overridden in a subclass, except if
        the starting process has to completely change.  Prefer overriding
        `setup` or `init` which are called by `start`.  Sub-services
        also are started in this method.  If you feel like you really have
        to override 'start', call the parent method with 'super'.

        Order of execution:
            1.  `start` first calls the service's `init` method, which is
                where new attributes should be defined.  You can think of
                `init` as an alternative, asynchronous constructor, though
                this is not entirely true.
            2.  Then sub-services are started (their `start`  method
                is called and awaited).
            3.  Finally the service `setup` method is called.

            In other words, if you override `init`, you can be sure no
            sub-service of this service has been started yet.  However,
            if you override `setup`, you know sub-services have been
            started.  What you will most need depends primarily on when
            you need your code to be executed.

        A last concern arises from the asychronous nature of these
        methoids:  they won't block execution directly, but the result
        of each will be awaited before the next step in the process
        is followed.  If you want to do something that will take
        time to complete, or will need to run in parallel (for instance,
        create a TCP server), then consider using
        `asyncio.create_task` to start a task during the `setup`
        method.  If you do that, capture the task in an attribute so that
        you can cancel it in `cleanup`, if needed.
