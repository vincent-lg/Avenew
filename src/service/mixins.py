"""This module doesn't contain a service, but a mixin.

The CmdMixin is used to exchange commands that have been pickled.  It needs
a `reader` and `writer` to work and will cache what it receives until it
can unpickle something useful.

This mixin is used by the CRUX (server) and host (client) service, as
communication is similar.

    """
    Command mixin, used to transfer commands with arguments.

    A command and argument are pickled into a tuple and sent over a writer.
    The reader on the opposite side of the connection then caches the
    result in a `BytesIO` object and subsequently tries to unpickle it.  If
    it succeeds, it tries to handle the command, which calls a method
    of a subclass of the mixin, or a parent service's.  See service/host.py
    for an example and more explanation on the process.

    Asynchronous methods:
        write_cmd(writer, command name, arguments): send a command.
        wait_for_cmd(reader, command name, timeout): wait for a command to be received.
