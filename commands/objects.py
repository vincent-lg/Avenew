    Use an object given in argument.

        use <object name>

    This command allows you to use an object with an obvious usage, like a phone
    or computer.  More specific commands are available for more specific actions.
    To use a phone that you have near at hand, for instance, just enter
    |huse|n followed by the name of the phone to use.

    Example:
        use computer
