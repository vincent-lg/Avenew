"""
A login menu using EvMenu.

Contribution - Vincent-lg 2016

This module defines a simple login system, similar to the one
defined in 'menu_login.py".  This present menu system, however,
uses EvMenu (hence the name).  This module contains the
functions (nodes) of the menu, with the CmdSet and
UnloggedCommand called when a user logs in.  In other words,
instead of using the 'connect' or 'create' commands once on the
login screen, players have to navigate through a simple menu
asking them to enter their username (then password), or to type
'new' to create one.  You may want to update your login screen
if you use this system.

When you'll reload the server, new sessions will connect to the
new login system, where they will be able to:

* Enter their username, assuming they have an existing player.
* Enter 'NEW' to create a new player.

The top-level functions in this file are menu nodes (as
described in EvMenu).  Each one of these functions is
responsible for prompting the user with a specific information
(username, password and so on).  At the bottom of the file are
defined the CmdSet for Unlogging users, which adds a new command
(defined below) that is called just after a new session has been
created, in order to create the menu.  See the specific
documentation on functions (nodes) to see what each one should
do.
