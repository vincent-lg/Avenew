"""
Light contrib to group objects by name and display plural names.

Evennia contrib - Vincent Le Goff 2017

This contrib allows to group object names (in 'look' for instance)
using their singualr names.  You could have a display varying from:
    You see: a rock, a rock
To:
    You see: a rock X 2
You could even customize it to have:
    You see: 2 rocks

To install, you simply need to import and inherit from the `PluralNames`
mixin in your typeclasses.  Be sure to put it first in your inheritance
tree.  You could do it for all your typeclasses, or just your rooms for
instance.

```python
# Example with 'typeclasses/rooms.py'
from evennia import DefaultRoom

from contrib.plural import PluralNames

class Room(PluralNames, DefaultRoom):

    # ...
```

The `PluralNames` is a very light mixin that will override your
`return_apperance` hook.  You can, however, write your own `return_appearance`
hook and use the `group_objects` directly (see below for more information).

To change the way your objects will display plural names, you can
override the `get_plural_name` method (see the default implementation
below).  You can do so with all your typeclasses, if you don't like the default.

def group_objects(objects, attrname="key"):
    """
    Return the grouped list of objects, using their singular names.

    Args:
        objects (list ob Object): list of objects to be grouped.
        attrname (str, optional): the name of the singular attribute.

    Returns:
        grouped (list): the same list of objects grouped by names.
        The list will contain tuples of two information: the number (int)
        and the object (Object).

    Notes:
        In the case of grouping (if an entry has more than 1 object),
        only one of these objects will be displayed for grouping.
        This is usually the expected behavior.

        Grouping will occur based on the `attrname` argument.  By
        default, the objects' `key` are used as singular names.  You
        can provide a different attribute names.  It could be linked
        to a property, or an Evennia attribute (just give it
        "db.<name of attribute>" as value).
