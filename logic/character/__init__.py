"""
Game logic for characters.

This package contains character stats, skills, and whatever else regarding
characters but separate from the typeclass itself.  The Character typeclass
can still be found in `typeclasses/characters.py`.  This package mostly
contains handlers that are accessible through `Character` objects.
